# AlexanderDevelopment AccessTeamTemplateMover
This was a plugin for XrmToolBox that can be used to move access team templates (with GUIDs) between CRM organizations. For more information, please see the introductory post on my blog at [http://alexanderdevelopment.net/post/2015/10/20/xrmtoolbox-plugin-for-moving-access-team-templates](http://alexanderdevelopment.net/post/2015/10/20/xrmtoolbox-plugin-for-moving-access-team-templates).

THIS TOOL IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED. PLEASE USE MY CONFIGURATION DATA MOVER TOOL FOR WORKING WITH ACCESS TEAM TEMPLATES.http://alexanderdevelopment.net/post/2016/02/01/moving-access-team-templates-with-the-configuration-data-mover/
